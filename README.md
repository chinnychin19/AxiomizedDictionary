# AxiomizedDictionary

So the idea here is to find a subset of words that someone would need to understand in order to fully comprehend the English dictionary. Any such subset would serve as an "axiom" for the dictionary. This is similar to how all theorems in Mathematics are developed on top of fundamental axioms that are taken to be true.

This project has NOT been completed. Made this repo when I was bored one afternoon. Hoping to work on it more soon, but think I should throw out there that this is an NP-Complete problem, so I'll be searching for a small subset, but not necessarily the smallest subset.
