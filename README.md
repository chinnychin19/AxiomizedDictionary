# AxiomizedDictionary

So the idea here is to find a subset of words that someone would need to understand in order to fully comprehend the English dictionary. Any such subset would serve as an "axiom" for the dictionary.

The en.txt dictionary files was sourced from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sujithps/Dictionary/master/Oxford%20English%20Dictionary.txt).

## Some numbers so far

- Number of words: 26343
- Average number of words in definition: 15.76
- Words with empty definitions: "Bq" (short for "Becquerel")
